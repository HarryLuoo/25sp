= Project Proposal/ Abstract: Plague of AI
=== Harry Luo, March 2025


Plagues of the past teach us a truth: they spread fast, tear at norms, test what holds us together, and force us to answer or to break. A plague isn’t just disease—it’s any force that sweeps through society, disrupts the old ways, and demands we adapt. Under this lens, the rise of generative AI can be seen as a modern plague. 

This paper explores its reach. Generative AI fits the shadow of a plague: it’s in our schools, our work, our art -- reshaping how we think, how we create. We will track its path under a framework inspired by lessons we could draw from historical plagues: silent escalation, exposing inequalities, demand collective action, reshaping behaviors and norms, and often pushes for cultural evolution. 

Plagues forced progress—sanitation after cholera, vaccines after smallpox. Could AI’s "plague" push us to rethink education, ethics, or even what makes us human? It’s a threat and a chance.
