<p>You have 50 minutes. There are a total of 2 problems, both of which have multiple parts. The exam is a total of 50 points. The following mathematical identities may be useful:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
&amp; \text { Taylor series: } \quad e^{x} \approx 1+x+\frac{1}{2} x^{2}+\ldots, \quad x \ll 1 \
&amp; \text { Gaussian integral: } \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \mathrm{d} x e^{-a x^{2}}=\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{a}}

<p>Problem 1: (Spin-1) Consider a system of noninteracting atoms with spin-1 at fixed absolute temperature $T$ and placed in an external magnetic field $H$. The possible energies of an individual atom are</p>
<p>$$
\varepsilon_{m}=-g \mu_{B} H m
$$</p>
<p>where $m=-1,0,1$. The component of the magnetic moment along $H$ is $\mu=g \mu_{B} m$.
(a) Calculate the partition function $Z$ and Helmholtz free energy $F$ for a single spin.
(b) Explicitly calculate the mean magnetic moment $\bar{\mu}$.</p>
<p>(c) The average "magnetization" of the system is $\bar{M}=n \bar{\mu}$, where $n$ is the number of atoms per unit volume. In the limit of a weak field, $g \mu_{B} H \ll T$, show that the magnetization can be written $\bar{M}=\chi H$ and determine $\chi$ (the magnetic susceptibility).
(d) Determine the limiting behavior of $\bar{M}$ in the high-field limit $g \mu_{B} H \gg T$. Explain how you could have written this answer down without any calculation.</p>
<p>Problem 2: (Ideal gas with spin-1/2) Consider an ideal gas of $N$ indistinguishable particles, each with spin- $1 / 2$, at fixed absolute temperature $T$. The energy of such a system in an applied magnetic field $H$ is</p>
<p>$$
E=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left(\frac{\mathbf{p}<em>{i}^{2}}{2 m}-g \mu</em>{B} H s_{i}\right)
$$</p>
<p>where $\mathbf{p}<em>{i}$ are the momenta of the particles and $s</em>{i}=-1 / 2,+1 / 2$ are the projections of their spin along the applied field $H$.
(a) Treating the coordinates and momenta $\left(\mathbf{q}<em>{i}, \mathbf{p}</em>{i}\right)$ classically, but the spin degrees of freedom as discrete, calculate the partition function $Z$.
(b) Calculate the mean energy $\bar{E}$ of the gas.</p>
<p>(c) Calculate the heat capacity $C_{V}=(\partial \bar{E} / \partial T)_{V}$ of the gas.</p>
